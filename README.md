# Uncommon ActionScript Errors and Debugging Techniques

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur in ActionScript 3, along with techniques for debugging and resolving them.  ActionScript, being an older language, has its quirks, and these examples highlight some of them.

## Errors Covered

* **Null Pointer Dereferences:** Accessing properties of null objects.
* **Type Coercion Issues:** Unexpected type conversions leading to errors.
* **Event Handling Pitfalls:** Problems managing event listeners and dispatching events.
* **Memory Leaks:**  Subtle issues that can lead to performance degradation or crashes. (Advanced example, might require additional files.)

## Debugging Strategies

* **`trace()` statements:** Essential for monitoring variable values and program flow.
* **The ActionScript debugger:** Use the debugger in Flash Professional or FlashDevelop to step through code and inspect variables.
* **Error handling with `try...catch` blocks:** Handle potential exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes.
* **Logging:** Create comprehensive logs to analyze program behavior and isolate issues.
